…me

Hi, I’m Marikannan. I am a system/application programmer based in Chennai, India. I am passionate about anything that deals with logical reasoning whether it is mathematics or programming and has always been since I was a kid. I see the technology as one of the transforming tool for human well-being as long as it is used with good intention. I have always been interested in programming, and all the technologies which brought comfort to our day to day life especially the way we communicate.

As for work, I specialise in the design and development of back-end applications, with a strong interest in performance and scalability. I tend not to stick to a particular technology or tool set; I enjoy working with whichever technologies and tools that best suit the needs of each project. However, for the past few years my tools of choice for most projects have been the C language , Python, Unix/Linux and SQL. However, my interest in technology knows no boundaries.
