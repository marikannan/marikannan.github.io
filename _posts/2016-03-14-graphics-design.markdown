In the last weekend, I attended the IEEE madras section workshop on "Graphics Design". Though I am core software programmer, always I have the interest in design aspects atleast to the extent I can design simple poster or e-flyer for some of the outreach programs. Most of the time, I used GIMP and Inkscape for this purpose.

In the IEEE workshop, I got the intro into "Adobe Photoshop" and had hands-on in the basic tools to start with. In the workshop I designed few simple logo. I know it is like kids kirukkal :).
Hope one day will do good design ...
