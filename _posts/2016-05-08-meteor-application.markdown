Today came across the framework [**Meteorjs**](https://www.meteor.com/) which can be used to build pure javascript apps in faster way. I find it bit magical to build an meteor application though I have less understanding of front end technologies at this point of time. The app will work in web , mobile and desktop. I think its gonna help me in some of the opensource projects in coming days.
